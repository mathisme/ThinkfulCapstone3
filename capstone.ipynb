    "At least 17 million adults in the US suffer from depression each year.<sup>[2](#references)</sup>  And, according to the NCBI article, <u>Depression: How effective are antidepressants?</u><sup>[1](#references)</sup>, only 40 to 60 percent of those with severe depression who take antidepressants notice an improvement in their symptoms.  In this project I would like to explore how adults suffering from depression can be clustered.  If a clear seperation of clusters can be found, tailored treatments can be created to better help those sufferening from depression.  This is a topic of personal interest as my husband suffers from chronic depression."
